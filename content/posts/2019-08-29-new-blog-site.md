The new blog site is written by Hugo, and served on Netlify. I used to make AWS S3 site, but that requires the configuration of S3/Route53/CloudFront, and HTTPS part is a little bit too complex for my simple blog site. Now with the help of Netlify, I can serve the blog site with almost no cost, and still have the full functionalities for most things AWS can provide.
